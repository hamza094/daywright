## Principles, Vision, and Goals

This section outlines the core ideas that guide how DayWright is built and how it evolves over time. These principles shape product decisions, the long-term vision defines where the project is heading, and the goals describe what we aim to deliver in practice.

### Principles

- Simplicity over complexity: features should reduce friction, not add it.
- Transparency by default: activity, progress, and decisions should be visible.
- Open-source mindset: code should be readable, testable, and easy to contribute to.
- Pragmatic design: prefer practical solutions over unnecessary abstraction.

### Vision

To reduce project complexity by bringing tasks, collaboration, and progress into one clear system.

### Goals

DayWright is built with a few clear goals in mind:

- **Simple by design**: The entire experience should feel clean, intuitive, and effortless. You shouldn’t need a tutorial to get work done.
- **Open and transparent**: DayWright is open-source because we believe tools should be trustworthy. Anyone can review the code, suggest improvements, or help shape the future of the project.
- **Friendly for contributors**: We aim to keep the codebase straightforward and easy to navigate. This helps new contributors onboard quickly and ensures long-term maintainability.
- **Accessible anywhere**: Whether you're working on a laptop, tablet, or phone, DayWright should feel fast and comfortable to use. Our goal is to support a smooth experience across different environments.
