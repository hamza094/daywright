### Goals

DayWright is built with a few clear goals in mind:

- **Simple by design**: The entire experience should feel clean, intuitive, and effortless. You shouldn’t need a tutorial to get work done.
- **Open and transparent**: DayWright is open-source because we believe tools should be trustworthy. Anyone can review the code, suggest improvements, or help shape the future of the project.
- **Friendly for contributors**: We aim to keep the codebase straightforward and easy to navigate. This helps new contributors onboard quickly and ensures long-term maintainability.
- **Accessible anywhere**: Whether you're working on a laptop, tablet, or phone, DayWright should feel fast and comfortable to use. Our goal is to support a smooth experience across different environments.
